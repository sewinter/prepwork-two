# High Card Points

In the card game bridge, four cards are given point values: Jack: 1, Queen: 2, King: 3, Ace: 4. Given an array of strings corresponding to a hand of cards (the cards are represented like so: `["2","3","4","5","6","7","8","9","10","J","Q","K","A"]`), return the total number of high card points for that hand.

E.g., `high_card_points(["2","3","4","5","6","7","8","9","10","J","Q","K","A"]) => 10`
`high_card_points(["2", "A", "A"]) => 8`
