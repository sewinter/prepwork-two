# Introduction: Step 2

Hey folks,

Welcome to App Academy's Prep Step 2. This step consists of two more chapters of
curriculum and nine practice problems (three easy, three medium, and three hard)
that will prepare you for your technical interview. Each level of difficulty
features a primer video, in which we'll walk through a problem. We highly
recommend that you watch them to warm up and to get a better sense of how to
approach more sophisticated problems.

Before you begin this step, you should have completed our Step 1
[curriculum][step1] and passed the online coding assessment. Feel free to refer
to the Step 1 [curriculum][step1] to refresh your fundamentals.

When you've finished the curriculum for Prep Step 2, you should be well prepared
for your technical interview over Skype with a TA from App Academy.

If you have extra time before the interview and would like more practice, we
recommend you check out [codewars](https://www.codewars.com/).
