# Control Flow

So far the Ruby interpreter has executed all of our programs sequentially and
continuously:

More sophisticated programs require manipulating **control flow**, the order in
which instructions are executed within a program. One modifies control flow
using **control structures**, blocks of code that alter the control flow based
on analysis of given parameters. We'll first examine **conditional statements**,
which instruct the interpreter to execute different branches of code depending
upon whether a condition is true or false.
