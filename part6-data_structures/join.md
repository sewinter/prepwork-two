# `join`

The `join` method type converts an array to a string. As its name suggests, it
joins every element in the array, each of which is implicitly converted to a
string. `join` takes an optional argument: the separator. The separator is a
string that the method splices between every element in the joined array. By
default, there is no separator. The `join` method does not modify the original
array.
