# Data Structures Exercises

Fill in each of the method bodies. Instructions for each method are in the comments. Do not modify any code at the bottom of the file (it's used for testing).

All the problems from medium on are as difficult as real App Academy admission problems, so don't be discouraged!

Test your code by running it line-by-line in the shell.

Click run to test your code against the specs: successes and errors will appear in the shell. Do your best to correct any failing code before reviewing the solutions.

When you're done, check out the [solutions and video walkthrough][walkthrough]. Happy solving!
