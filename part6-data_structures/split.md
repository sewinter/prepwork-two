# `split`

The `split` method is the opposite of `join`. While `join` combines the elements
of an array into a string, `split` divides a string into an array. Like `join`,
`split` takes an optional argument: the delimiter. The delimiter is a string
along which `split` divides the receiver string. Whatever string you use as the
delimiter will be omitted from the returned array. By default, the delimiter is
an empty space (`' '`). The `split` method does not modify the original string.
